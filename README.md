# Computer Vision Projects Using DL

My major is application of Machine learning (especially deep learning) in PHM(Prognostic and Health Management). Deep learning has a wide range of applications. In order to learn the deep learning technology comprehensively, I will explore the application of deep learning in other fields. And this repository is about computer vision including following sections:

- Images classification
    - Cat V.S Dog
- Target detection
    - Self-made data set (to be determined)
- Semantic segmentation
    - COCO Dataset
- Visualization
    - Three simple methods
- Neural style transfer
    - Method from original paper
    - Generate caricature-style avatars (Self-made data set)
- DCGAN
    - Generate face (LFW dataset)
    - Defogging
- WGAN
    - Generate face (LFW dataset)
    - Defogging
- ACGAN 
    - Generate animation avatar
- VAE
    - Generate face (Kaggel 2013 dataset, Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge)
- DeepDream
    - Method from original paper
- Key point positioning
- Transfer learning
    - Fine-tune
    - Domain adversarial neural network
