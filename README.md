# Computer Vision Projects Using DL

My major is application of Machine learning (especially deep learning) in PHM(Prognostic and Health Management). Deep learning has a wide range of applications. In order to learn the deep learning technology comprehensively, I will explore the application of deep learning in other fields. And this repository is about computer vision including following sections:

- Images classification
- Target detection
- Semantic segmentation
- Visualization
- Neural style transfer
- GAN
- VAE
- DeepDream
- Transfer learning

This repository will be updated continuously, welcome your attention.If you have any questions or criticism and suggestions, you can put them on issues.
